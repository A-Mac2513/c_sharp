# c_sharp
A colelction of all the C_sharp apps I had done while in school

## [Temperature Conversion App](https://github.com/A-Mac2513/c_sharp/tree/main/temp_conversion)
This was my very first app!  It's a basic console app.  Takes in so user input, does some RegEx, integer parsing, and uses some try/catch blocks. Then it can take a temperature and convert it based on the user selection.
